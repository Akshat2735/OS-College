Q1. Find the output of the following shell scripts 

echo Enter value for n
read n
sum=0
i=1
while [ $i -le $n ]
do
    sum=$((sum + i))
    i=$((i + 2))
done
echo Sum is $sum

OUTPUT:
If the user enters n = 5, the odd numbers less than or equal to 5 are 1, 3, and 5. The calculation would be:

Iteration 1: sum = 0 + 1 = 1, i becomes 3
Iteration 2: sum = 1 + 3 = 4, i becomes 5
Iteration 3: sum = 4 + 5 = 9, i becomes 7 (exit loop)

Sum is 9.
